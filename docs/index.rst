Metagov is a unified API gateway for digital governance services. It's designed to support rapid prototyping of governance systems and workflows across a range of platforms. To help people prototype, Metagov ships with a powerful driver for authoring governance policies over multiple platforms, as well as a type system to help structure the connections between different services.

Currently supported governance services:

* OpenCollective
* Web Monetization
* SourceCred
* PolicyKit
* Stanford Participatory Budgeting Platform
* NEAR (sort of)

Currently supported platforms:

* Discourse

Metagov is a prototype under active development, so please help us out by sending us feedback at hello@metagov.org or by opening an issue on [our GitHub](https://github.com/metagov/metagov-prototype)!
