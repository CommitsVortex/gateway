				<p class="subtitle">Infrastructure for online communities</p>

				<p>The <a href="http://metagov.org/gateway" target="_blank">Metagov Gateway</a> is an open-source API gateway for online communities.

				<h2>Today’s communities are multi-platform</h2>
				<p class="small">Communities are defined by their people, and people naturally congregate across multiple platforms and services. Like <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-does-an-api-gateway-do" target="_blank">traditional enterprise gateways</a>, the Metagov Gateway helps manage and connect these platforms, making communities more accessible and more cohesive.

				<h2>Popular applications with the click of a button</h2>
				<p class="small">Want a reputation system on top of Slack? What about a voting system for expenses on Open Collective? Gateway integrates a range of out-of-the-box governance tools such as Open Collective, Loomio, SourceCred, and the Web Monetization standard as well as common utilities like voting, identity resolution, and API analytics. </p>

				<h2>Connecting Web2 and Web3</h2>
				<p class="small">Tokens are not just investments; they confer rights. But those rights only matter when they are exerted. Metagov Gateway helps connect Web3 communities to the social platforms where they interact. On the horizon: integrations for DAOs, blockchains, and other Web3 tools like Snapshot, Kleros, and Coordinape.</p>

				<h2>Innovate with governance</h2>
				<p class="small">The Gateway is designed to support rapid prototyping of governance systems, decision-making processes, and social workflows across a range of platforms, from forums to chat services to blockchains. To help people prototype, Gateway also ships with a powerful driver, PolicyKit, for authoring governance policies.
