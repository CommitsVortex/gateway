# Metagov

Metagov is intended to help developers and users quickly prototype and deploy governance modules and governance structures within any online community (across games, blockchains, and social networks). It is being developed by the [Metagovernance Project](www.metagov.org), a nonprofit research group focused on the governance of virtual worlds.

Currently, this repo is mostly a placeholder for documentation related to speccing out early prototypes of the toolset. It is intended to facilitate and serve as a site for collaboration with developers interested in contributing to the project.

We are currently working on **Metagov v0.1 aka Govbase**, a shared data model, prototyped in a database, for governance designers and metagovernance designers. See metagov.org/govbase.

## Development roadmap
To get a broad sense of what is going on, take a look at the diagram below.

Roughly, we are prototyping **the agreement engine**, which will be used to draft both (dumb and smart) contracts and organizational charters / constitutions. The final output has to port into a range of social platforms, from blockchains to social networks to certain online games, but currently we can ignore questions of portability and just think about the basic logic and user experience.

Once you understand the general idea of the tool (feel free to ask questions!), use the roadmap below to figure out what needs doing. Note that the roadmap is constantly evolving (after all, this is a research project!). The most up-to-date version of the roadmap can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QDq89dogQb-K2jdDV5QL4Lqi8yehE3aiXzwVG8D24rY/edit#).
