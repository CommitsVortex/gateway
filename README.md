# Metagov

Metagov is intended to help developers and users quickly prototype and deploy different governance systems within any online community (across games, blockchains, and social networks). This project is part of the [Metagovernance Project](www.metagov.org), an interdisciplinary research project focused on the governance of virtual worlds. 

Currently, this repo is mostly a placeholder for documentation related to specifying early prototypes of the toolset. It is intended to facilitate and serve as a site for collaboration with other developers interested in contributing to the project.

## Currently
I am currently (Aug. 28, 2020) working on **Metagov v0.1 aka Govbase** Michael Zargham. Govbase is a shared data model for governance designers and metagovernance designers. It's also a data set of online governance structures. See the repo (https://github.com/thelastjosh/govbase), the Airtable (https://airtable.com/shrgnUrj0dqzZDsOd) or the  placeholder explainer page (metagov.org/govbase).

## Vision
To get a broad sense of what is going on, take a look at the diagram below (credit: Larry Lessig, JT).

Roughly, we are prototyping **the agreement engine**, which will be used to draft both (dumb and smart) contracts and organizational charters / constitutions. It turns out that there are a LOT of choices we can make in designing this kind of engine---I am currently writing out a protocol spec.

The final output has to port into a range of social platforms, from blockchains to social networks to certain online games, but currently we can ignore questions of portability and just think about the basic logic and user experience.

## Roadmap
Once you understand the general idea of the tool (feel free to ask questions!), use the roadmap below to figure out what needs doing. Note that the roadmap is constantly evolving (after all, this is a research project!).
