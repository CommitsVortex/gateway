# Metagov

Metagov is intended to help developers and users quickly prototype and deploy different governance systems within any online community (across games, blockchains, and social networks). This project is part of the [Metagovernance Project](www.metagov.org), an interdisciplinary research project focused on the governance of virtual worlds. 

Currently, this repo is mostly a placeholder for documentation related to specifying early prototypes of the toolset. It is intended to facilitate and serve as a site for collaboration with other developers interested in contributing to the project.

## Currently
We are currently working on the Metagov Core (which manages plugins) and the interface between the Core and the Driver, currently PolicyKit. Simultaneously, other teams at Metagov are working on [Metagov v0.1 aka Govbase](https://github.com/thelastjosh/govbase) and the Agreement Engine, which will be used to draft both (dumb and smart) contracts and organizational charters / constitutions.

## Vision
To get a broad sense of what is going on, take a look at the diagram below (credit: Larry Lessig, Joshua Tan).

## Roadmap
Once you understand the general idea of the tool (feel free to ask questions!), use the roadmap below to figure out what needs doing. Note that the roadmap is constantly evolving (after all, this is a research project!).

Roughly, we are prototyping **2, 1, and 3**, in that order. The final output has to port into a range of social platforms, from blockchains to social networks to certain online games, but currently we're ignoring questions of portability and just thinking about the basic logic and user experience.
